In addition, each student will present their findings to the class. All profiles will include interviews with relevant designers and developers. In the coming days, we’ll explore possible profile ideas and assign due dates by lottery. We’ll present about one a week beginning after spring break.</p>

	<p><strong>Midterms</strong>: There are two distinct midterm projects. For Thursday, March 6, there is a group presentation-driven project focused on design analysis and research of a large-scale news site.
