<h2>Using Github</h2>

Git is the way most programmers work on coding projects together. You&rsquo;ll need to submit your coding assignments to the <a href="https://github.com/tysone/2014-columbia-projects">class Git repository</a>. Git can seem complicated, but you&rsquo;ll get the hang of publishing the code changes you make on your computer out to the resposity, where others can see them.
