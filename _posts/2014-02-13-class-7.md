How to avoid confusing your readers.

Guest speaker: Amanda Cox, The New York Times

Homework assignment (Due February 20, 2014):

Scenario: You&rsquo;re a Web editor for a travel magazine after graduation. Your editor wants to put together a list of the hottest travel destinations for summer. Your job is to compile a list of five to 10 places and present them on a page. 

At a minimum, you&rsquo;ll need a headline and summary for the page, and something compelling for each location. I don&rsquo;t want just a UL/LI of 10 names. Make this visually interesting. 

Things to consider: 

1. Art. You need it. Use any relevant photos/video/illustration you want that you have permission to use. Copyrighted art that you don&rsquo;t have rights to are not acceptable. Creative Commons licensed photos are a good place to start. [You can search Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/search/advanced/) for just Creative Common licensed photos.  Make sure you adhere to the licensing/attribution terms of any art you use. 
2. Write some sample copy for your presentation. You don&rsquo;t have to do a fully researched/reported piece, but give us a sense of what tone and length of text you have in mind. If you have 10 places on your list, come up with copy for one place. Use filler text for the others, if you like. 
3. Type. We&rsquo;ve been talking about type a lot in class. This is a great exercise to practice. 
4. Type selectors. Class selectors. Use them. If you want to get fancier than we’ve done in class, go for it.
5. Don&rsquo;t worry about branding the magazine. You can if you like, but I&rsquo;m more interested in the individual story. 
6. Be prepared to present your assignment. Many of you will be asked to.

You can model a design on this one, but please don&rsquo;t take it directly and don&rsquo;t just copy the code. Your work should feel original. It can deviate greatly from what I’ve done.
