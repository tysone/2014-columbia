## Assignment

**Read** — The introduction and chapter one of the [HTML&CSS book](http://htmlandcssbook.com/). Also read the essay by Jeffrey Zeldman, ["Understanding Web Design."](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingwebdesign)


**Due Tuesday 2/28** — Inventory and annotate the homepage and article page of a major news Web site; note the major layout components, content types (by color-coding regions) and aesthetic choices (colors, fonts, grid). Assignments should be submitted as a link to published Google Docs Drawings.

*Taking screenshots of entire Web pages:* There are a number of ways to do this. You can use an add-on for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ckibcdccnfeookdmbahgiakhnjcddpki), or a standalone (and free) application like [Paparazzi](http://derailer.org/paparazzi/downloads).

*Making annotated diagrams:* Go to Google Docs. Under the Create New menu, select Drawing. Then, under the Insert menu, select Image. Select your screenshot. Then be sure to select 100% from the View menu to see your image at the correct scale. Begin using the drawing tools to annotate and classify the page. Create a legend to note common fonts, colors. Share your document so anyone with the link can see it. The result should be a URL like this that you will submit to the [shared assignment spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_VwvDNOCtKi022Bf1fb9Hs74CByOv7sTIUuI9gmvqU4/edit?usp=sharing).
