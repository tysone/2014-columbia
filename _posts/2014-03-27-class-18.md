**Agenda**

**Assignments** Due before class Thursday, April 3

* [Contact your news nerd profile subject](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fo7UejAGxG9txnK1N7Xm3Col2RT3NwefCaKfkXS9U6k/edit)
* Start a new page, and make three colored rectangles. Use jQuery to change the class names of the rectangles when a user clicks on them. When clicked on, one rectangle should change colors, one rectangle should get wider, and one rectangle should get rounded corners.
* Start a second new page, and include a fake headline and a paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Style the text on the page using one custom font from Google Fonts.

**Common Questions**

*How do I include jQuery on my page?*
Paste the following code into your HTML file immediately before the `</body>` tag on your page:

`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`

*How do I include my own Javascript on my page?*
Put it inline in your HTML file by including an opening and closing script tag. Your Javascript goes between the `<script>` and `</script>` tags. Like with the jQuery link, your Javascript should go directly before the `</body>` tag in your HTML document.

Here is what that looks like:

`<html>`
`<body>`
Here is some HTML
`<script>`
// Here is some Javascript
`</script>`
`</body>`
`</html>`
