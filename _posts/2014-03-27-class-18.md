title: More Javascript and Custom Fonts
week: 10
summary: First steps with jQuery
---

**Agenda**

* Weekly discussions.
* Building blocks of Javascript.
* Work session on Javascript.
* Custom fonts.

**Assignments** Due before class Tuesday, April 1

* Contact your news nerd profile subject
* Start a new page, and make three colored rectangles. Use jQuery to change the class names of the rectangles when a user clicks on them. When clicked on, one rectangle should change colors, one rectangle should get wider, and one rectangle should get rounded corners.
* Start a second new page, and include a fake headline and a paragraph of lorem ipsum text. Style the text on the page using one custom font from Google Fonts.

**Common Questions**

*How do I include jQuery on my page?*

Paste the following code into your HTML file immediately before the `</body>` tag on your page:

`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`

*How do I include my own Javascript on my page?*

Put it inline in your HTML file by including an opening and closing script tag. Your Javascript goes between the `<script>` and `</script>` tags. Like with the jQuery link, your Javascript should go directly before the `</body>` tag in your HTML document. It should go after the jQuery code.

Here is what that looks like:

`<html>`<br />
`<body>`<br />
Here is some HTML<br />
`<script>`<br />
`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>`<br />
// Here is some Javascript<br />
`</script>`<br />
`</body>`<br />
`</html>`

*Why can't I figure this out? Is this really hard?*

Yes. Javascript is more complex than CSS. But you can learn it. We will spend a lot of time in class going over the basic ideas.

*Where can I find an example of simple uses of jQuery?*
